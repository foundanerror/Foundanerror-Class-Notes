## What is Programming? 


Programming is the process of getting the computer to complete specific tasks. 

Computers are considered very dumb machines. We have to give the computer **very specific** orders so it can complete the specific task without making mistakes. Computers are only as sophisticated because we as programmers, program them to be.

Computers only understand something called machine code. Which is also known as binary. Every instruction fed into the computer is converted into 0's and 1's to quickly carry out the task.

To make the computer carry out a specific task, we have to convert our instructions into machine code for the computer to understand. But it is very difficult to convert English into machine code. This problem is all solved with programming languages.

## Programming Languages & Interpreters 

Programming languages can be seen as a middle man for translating programs we write in programming languages into machine code. 
Interpreters and Compilers are used to converting programming language into machine code to carry out the specific function. 



Some programming languages are low-level programming languages, this means that they are close to machine code. Other programming languages are high and mid-level programming languages, meaning that they are farther away from machine code, also meaning that there are fewer specific things you need to code yourself. 

!!! note
    Compilers are used to convert high-level programming languages into low-level programming languages. The compiler reads all your code at once and actually executes it after. Interpreters are a type of compiler that compiles the code as it goes.
